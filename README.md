# Inverter-Backup-Indicator
Inverter Backup Indicator Using Arduino Nano
Iridescent India have inverter battery indicator, however shows the last level of limit. The 90% of inverter fabricates 
has no limit demonstrating worked in framework in their inverters. Remaining inverter with indictors is an excess of 
exorbitant. The inverter backup time indicator will assist us with figuring out the number of time will endure inverter 
battery or any battery which is associated with the Load system. This inverter backup time indicator will assist the 
consumer with dealing with the battery utilization as indicated by their capacities and know about unexpected shut 
down of the inverters. The Arduino Nano is a vital part, which is little in size and accompanies most recent 
microcontroller chipset. That makes the inverter backup time indicator compact and more reliable. The model has 
been carried out utilizing little battery. A basic technique is created to get the inverter backup time. It very well may be 
executed on any home inverter battery by rolling out certain improvements in source code of Arduino Nano.
